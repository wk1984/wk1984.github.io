**Source of P value - Great contribution of R.A. Fisher**

R.A Fisher suggested that:

 * "The value for which P=0.05, or 1 in 20, is 1.96 or nearly 2 ; it is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not." [Fisher, Ronald, 1925]

Then you should feel encourage to pursue the finding furthermore.

**What are new things after almost one century**

73 statisticians want to change the threshold, as Benjamin et al. (2017) said:

 * "We propose to change the default P-value threshold for statistical significance from 0.05 to 0.005 for claims of new discoveries."

It has received a lot of attention.

Actually, 30 years ago, Berger and Delampady (1987) has indicated:

 * “when testing precise hypotheses, formal use of P-values should be abandoned. Almost anything will give a better indication of the evidence provided by the data against H0.” (p. 330)"
