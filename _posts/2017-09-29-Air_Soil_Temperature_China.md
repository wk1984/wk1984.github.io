> - They analyzed the differences between soil temperature and air temperature across China by using ground-based observations.
> - They also compared the trends of air and soil temperature.

	> "The interdecadal variations of the tendencies of GST and SAT appear associated with the increase of snow depth in northern China (north of 40°N) in winter in recent decades, especially in northern Xinjiang, northern Inner Mongolia, and most parts of Northeast China."
