Today, I did a talk in NSIDC.

It is the first long talk in English, which is about 50 minutes and an hour plusing discussion, although I have been here for one and half year.

Twenty or more person attended there or online.

I thought I would be tensional but not actually.

Put the front and end pages of this presentation here.

Good luck!
