In order to improve the English language skill, including writing, reading, and listening, bunch materials in different aspects is needed actually while not only the related science. 

Some sentences or words may be useful in future writing. They are in bold font.

Christopher Merchant, Professor, University of Reading and UK National Centre for Earth Observation:

It is correct to state that the amount by which the recorded global temperature of 2016 exceeds that of 2015 (0.04 °C) is within the margin of error (0.15 °C) that NOAA quote (table in [1]). One can correctly state that **“no one really knows” in that sense**. An alternative statement of the same facts is that there is a **better-than-even** chance that 2016 was warmer than 2015. Note that while 2016 exceeds 2015 by an amount that is statistically small, years previous to 2015 were significantly cooler. For example, the year of the warm temperature “spike” in 1998 [2] discussed later in the article was recorded as 0.27 °C cooler than 2015, **which illustrates the trend to warmer temperatures underlying the year-to-year fluctuations**.

In the NH there is positive surface albedo feedback in the annual mean from 25° to 90°N. This positive feedback **is constrained to** 25°–55°N in the NH winter **owing to** the absence of sunlight in high latitudes. The peak **centered on** 33°N (Fig. 4b) is due to the Himalaya. In the NH spring the greatest surface albedo feedback is from 45° to 75°N mainly because of snow over land, whereas during the NH summer the peak **narrows and moves poleward**. Snow over land has largely melted by the summer but the sea ice melts later in the year. There is very little surface albedo feedback in the NH autumn when snow and ice coverage is small. The eight models **behave very differently** in the NH summer poleward of 80°N (differences .10 W m-2 K-1) where three models have a surface albedo feedback that becomes negative (not shown). For most of these models the error in the feedback at these high latitudes during summer is quite large and, therefore, **these results should be interpreted with caution**. The Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E-R (GISS-ER) **behaves quite differently to** other models **in having** the weakest annual mean surface albedo feedback in the SH sea ice zone *but* the strongest annual mean surface albedo feedback in the Himalaya (Fig. 4b). **This weak annual mean surface albedo feedback in the SH sea ice zone contributes to it having one of the smaller equilibrium temperature changes and a small SH polar amplification** (see Table 1).
