In order to improve the English language skill, including writing, reading, and listening, bunch materials in different aspects is needed actually while not only the related science. 

Some sentences or words may be useful in future writing. They are in bold font.

Christopher Merchant, Professor, University of Reading and UK National Centre for Earth Observation:

It is correct to state that the amount by which the recorded global temperature of 2016 exceeds that of 2015 (0.04 °C) is within the margin of error (0.15 °C) that NOAA quote (table in [1]). One can correctly state that **“no one really knows” in that sense**. An alternative statement of the same facts is that there is a **better-than-even** chance that 2016 was warmer than 2015. Note that while 2016 exceeds 2015 by an amount that is statistically small, years previous to 2015 were significantly cooler. For example, the year of the warm temperature “spike” in 1998 [2] discussed later in the article was recorded as 0.27 °C cooler than 2015, **which illustrates the trend to warmer temperatures underlying the year-to-year fluctuations**.
